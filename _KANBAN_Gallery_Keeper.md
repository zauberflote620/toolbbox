## Backlog

- [ ] Post-30h: Polish pass (upgrade pixel art, more particle effects)
- [ ] Post-30h: Content expansion (Einstein level, more artifacts)
- [ ] Post-30h: Feature additions (speedrun mode, leaderboards)
- [ ] Post-30h: Mobile optimization (touch controls, responsive)
- [ ] Post-30h: Educational extensions (teacher mode, quiz system)
- [ ] 

## Bugs / todo
- [ ] lvl 1 rm circles around "doors"
- [ ] Additional planning tools (TBD)
- [ ] refactor long files (levels)

## Level 2 UI/UX Improvements (Oct 4) - IN PROGRESS

### Asset Integration (Code Complete)
- [x] Add shadow to Bach character
- [x] Remove PNG frames - reverted to clean look (user preferred)
- [x] Rotate visitor characters each round (14 characters: robots + stick figures)
- [x] Use bubble-thinking-duo.png for visitor thought bubbles
- [x] Use banner-red.png for Bach speech with text overlay
- [x] Add 5 new stick figure characters to visitor pool
- [x] Organize assets into directories (shapes/, nature/, objects/, symbols/, frames/)
- [x] Move Bach speech bubble down to avoid overlap with character

### Visual Polish (Code Complete)
- [x] Add gradient backgrounds (body, canvas, buttons)
- [x] Add glassmorphism effect to HUD
- [x] Remove yellow circle outline (replaced with animated sparkle effect)
- [x] Improve text contrast in thought bubbles (dark red/blue on cream background)
- [x] Add shadows to all major elements

### Critical Bugs to Debug
- [ ] Figure out PNG transparency issue (white boxes around icons in paintings)
  - Code changed to skip colored background when PNG present
  - Need to test if icons (branches, clouds, toolbox, people) now show transparently
  - If still broken, may need to check PNG files themselves
- [ ] Verify all images loading correctly (check browser console for errors)
- [ ] Verify PNG paths correct for organized directories

### Testing & Validation Needed
- [ ] Test drag-and-drop with new layout and spacing
- [ ] Verify all animations working (sparkles, glow, floating, bobbing)
- [ ] Test visitor character rotation (should change each round)
- [ ] Verify speech bubbles display text correctly
- [ ] Verify 3 paintings show correctly (not just 1)

### Additional Polish (Not Started)
- [ ] Overall layout and spacing refinement
- [ ] Color scheme review and adjustments
- [ ] Additional shadows and depth where needed
- [ ] Performance optimization if needed
