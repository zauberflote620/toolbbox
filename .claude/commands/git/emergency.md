## Emergency Git Chaos Resolution

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Multi-Instance Git Chaos Detected**

You are experiencing the symptoms of multi-instance git chaos where multiple Claude instances have created repository conflicts. This command will coordinate with the git-coordinator agent to restore order.

Use the git-coordinator agent to:
1. **Emergency Assessment**: Lock repository, analyze chaos, create recovery points
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Auto-resolve safe conflicts (package locks, formatting)
3. **File Organization**: Intelligently group 900+ uncommitted files into logical commits  
4. **Branch Coordination**: Establish clear branch strategy and merge coordination
5. **State Management**: Persist progress and broadcast status to other instances

The git-coordinator will be your single source of truth for ALL git operations going forward.
