## üìã Session: Bug Fixes, Level 4, UI Stability (Oct 6, 2025)

**Date:** 251006
**Branch:** master
**Worktree:** /Volumes/pi_ext_drive/obsidian/Toolbox
**Current dir:** /Volumes/pi_ext_drive/obsidian/Toolbox/gallery-keeper
**Task File:** task-handoff-gallery-keeper.md

### Session Objective

Fix critical bugs in Gallery Keeper (victory restart button, unstable UI animations), build Level 4 (Question Corner with Turing mentor), and create comprehensive documentation.

### ‚úÖ Completed

- **Fixed Level 2 victory restart button** - Button was visible but non-functional (click handler checking wrong variable)
- **Removed unstable UI animations** - Fixed "wiggling like earthquake" issue by removing auto-animations and adding fixed seeds to Rough.js shapes
- **Built Level 4: Question Corner** - Complete 717-line implementation with Turing mentor teaching decision-making
- **Updated index.html** - Added Level 4 navigation link and description
- **Created CHANGELOG.md** - Comprehensive documentation with exact file changes, line numbers, code snippets, and rationale for every change

### üìÅ Key Files Modified

- **gallery-keeper/level2.html** (lines 1461-1469) - Added victory screen restart button click handler checking `game.restartButtonBounds`
- **gallery-keeper/shared/rough-ui.js** (lines 71-95, 157, 209, 287, 299, 343, 523, 577-587) - Removed animation system, added fixed `seed` parameters to all Rough.js shapes
- **gallery-keeper/shared/rough-ui-demo.html** (lines 178, 207-213, 225, 356, 359, 383) - Made progress bars static, simplified render loop
- **gallery-keeper/index.html** (lines 159-167) - Added Level 4 button and description

### üìù Key Files Created

- **gallery-keeper/level4.html** (717 lines) - Complete Question Corner level with Turing mentor, 20 questions, 3-card response system
- **gallery-keeper/CHANGELOG.md** (270+ lines) - Detailed changelog with all changes, code snippets, line numbers, rationale
- **gallery-keeper/MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md** (450 lines) - Design system documentation (Rough.js research, golden ratio, color palette)
- **gallery-keeper/FIXES_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md** (380 lines) - Bug fix summary and testing checklist
- **gallery-keeper/shared/rough-ui.js** (620 lines) - Stable UI component library with no auto-animations
- **gallery-keeper/shared/rough-ui-demo.html** (620 lines) - Component demo page showing stable UI

### üìç Exact Stopping Point

User requested Excalidraw diagram of vault architecture. All bug fixes complete, Level 4 complete, documentation complete. Session interrupted while about to create architecture diagram.

**User also noted index.html needs modernization:**
- Buttons are "extremely primitive"
- Remove all 90-degree angles (use rounded corners)
- Add shadows to components
- Use gradient backgrounds
- Research modern UI/UX design

### üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Create Excalidraw architecture diagram** - Scalable visual overview of Gallery Keeper vault structure
2. **Modernize index.html UI**:
   - Replace 90-degree corners with `border-radius`
   - Add `box-shadow` to buttons and containers
   - Use gradient backgrounds for buttons
   - Apply modern UI/UX principles
3. **Test all levels** - Verify victory restart works, no UI wiggling, Level 4 playable
4. **Commit changes** - 24 files modified, 41 untracked, organize into logical commits

### üõ†Ô∏è Commands & Context

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Volumes/pi_ext_drive/obsidian/Toolbox/gallery-keeper

# Verify current state
git status  # 1 staged, 24 modified, 41 untracked
git diff    # Review all changes

# Test the game
open index.html

# Test specific levels
open level2.html  # Test victory restart button
open level4.html  # Test new Question Corner level

# View specific changes
git diff level2.html      # Victory restart fix
git diff index.html       # Level 4 link added
cat level4.html          # New level (not tracked yet)
cat CHANGELOG.md         # Documentation

# When ready to commit
git add level2.html level4.html index.html CHANGELOG.md FIXES_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md
git commit -m "Fix Level 2 victory restart, remove UI animations, add Level 4"
git add shared/rough-ui.js shared/rough-ui-demo.html MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md
git commit -m "Add stable UI component library (no auto-animations)"
```

### üé® User Feedback on UI Design

**Critical feedback on index.html:**
- "Buttons are extremely primitive"
- "Do NOT use 90 degree angles in ANY buttons - all should be slightly rounded"
- "There should be shadow on most if not all components"
- "Backgrounds need to be gradient"
- "Really, please do some research on modern UI and UX design"

**This applies to:**
- `index.html` level selection buttons
- All future UI components
- May need to update level 1-4 buttons as well

### üêõ Bugs Fixed This Session

1. **Level 2 Victory Screen Restart Button**
   - **Problem:** Button drawn at line 1168, stores bounds in `game.restartButtonBounds`, but click handler only checked `game.restartButtonCanvasBounds`
   - **Fix:** Added separate click handler checking `game.restartButtonBounds` when `game.victoryState` is true
   - **Impact:** Victory restart now functional

2. **Unstable UI Animations**
   - **Problem:** Rough.js shapes regenerate random variations each frame, causing "wiggling like earthquake"
   - **Root Cause:** No fixed seed + animation system running constantly
   - **Fix:**
     - Removed animation system (`this.time`, `this.animations`, `update()` method)
     - Added `seed: 1` (or 2, 10) to all Rough.js shape calls
     - Removed `pulseAnimation()` method
   - **Impact:** All UI elements now stable at rest, animate ONLY on hover/click

### üí° Critical Context

**UI Animation Philosophy Learned:**
- User **STRONGLY** dislikes auto-animations without user interaction
- UI elements MUST be stable at rest (no wiggling, no pulsing, no movement)
- Animations/effects ONLY on user interaction (hover or click)
- Fixed seeds prevent Rough.js shape re-randomization each frame
- This is a HARD requirement going forward

**Level 4 Implementation Details:**
- Turing mentor teaches decision-making and customer service
- 20 unique questions (retail/museum scenarios)
- 3 response cards per question:
  - Perfect: specific, helpful, accurate (100 pts, green feedback)
  - Neutral: vague but not wrong (50 pts, yellow feedback)
  - Poor: unhelpful or confusing (10 pts, red feedback)
- Win condition: 15 perfect responses
- Questions and responses shuffle for replayability
- 3-second feedback display after each answer
- Blue theme to differentiate from other levels
- Teaches AI concepts: decision trees, contextual responses, pattern recognition

**Git Status:**
- **3 commits ahead** of origin/master
- **1 file staged:** level1.html (163 insertions, 733 deletions)
- **24 files modified:** Includes level2.html, index.html, and all new documentation
- **41 untracked files:** Including level4.html, CHANGELOG.md, shared/ directory
- Previous session did git history rewrite (all commits now authored by "QsPi <noreply@qspi.io>")

## üìã Session: Git History Cleanup (Oct 5, 2025)

**Date:** 251005
**Branch:** master
**Worktree:** /Volumes/pi_ext_drive/obsidian/Toolbox
**Current dir:** /Volumes/pi_ext_drive/obsidian/Toolbox/gallery-keeper
**Task:** Remove all Anthropic/Claude Code references from git commit history

### Session Objective
User discovered that all git commits were authored by "Claude Code <noreply@anthropic.com>" and requested complete removal of all Anthropic and Claude Code references from the entire commit history.

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Updated git config to use "QsPi <noreply@qspi.io>" as author
- Rewrote all 48 commits in repository history using `git filter-branch`
- Changed both GIT_AUTHOR_* and GIT_COMMITTER_* environment variables
- Cleaned up backup refs from filter-branch operation
- Cleared git stash to remove old author info
- Verified all commits now show "QsPi <noreply@qspi.io>" as author

### üìÅ Key Files Modified
**Git configuration:**
- Updated `.git/config` with new author credentials
- Rewrote entire commit history (48 commits)

**Modified but not committed:**
- `level1.html` - Modified by linter/system (background color changes)
- `levels/level1-greeting-hall.js` - System modifications
- `GK-Overview.md` - Obsidian drawing updates
- `_KANBAN_Gallery_Keeper.md` - Documentation updates
- Various Excalidraw asset deletions and additions

### üìç Exact Stopping Point
All git history rewriting is complete. User needs to force push the rewritten history to remote repository. No code work was interrupted - this was purely git maintenance.

### üîÑ Next Steps
1. **CRITICAL NEXT ACTION**: Force push rewritten history to remote:
   ```bash
   cd /Volumes/pi_ext_drive/obsidian/Toolbox && git push --force-with-lease origin master
   ```
2. Review modified files and decide whether to commit changes
3. Continue Gallery Keeper development (Level 3 is complete, Level 4 pending)

### üõ†Ô∏è Commands & Context
```bash
# Verify git author configuration
cd /Volumes/pi_ext_drive/obsidian/Toolbox
git config user.name   # Should show: QsPi
git config user.email  # Should show: noreply@qspi.io

# Verify commit history
git log -5 --format="%an <%ae> - %s"
# All commits should show: QsPi <noreply@qspi.io>

# Force push rewritten history (MUST DO)
git push --force-with-lease origin master

# Check working tree status
git status
```

### üí° Critical Context
**Git History Rewrite Details:**
- Used `git filter-branch` with `--env-filter` to rewrite all author/committer info
- Filter pattern: Changed any email matching "noreply@anthropic.com" to "noreply@qspi.io"
- All backup refs removed with: `git for-each-ref --format="%(refname)" refs/original/ | xargs -n 1 git update-ref -d`
- Stash cleared to remove any traces of old author
- **History has diverged from remote** - force push required

**User Motivation:**
User explicitly stated displeasure with Anthropic's practice of attributing work to "Claude Code" and wants all references removed. This is a non-negotiable requirement for this project.

**Gallery Keeper Project Status:**
- Level 1 (Greeting Hall): Complete
- Level 2 (Arrangement Room): Complete
- Level 3 (Living Gallery): Complete with all enhancements
- Level 4 (Question Corner): Now complete (see session above)
- All levels use Excalidraw assets and custom game engine

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current State & Issues
**No blocking issues.**

**Pending Work (from previous sessions):**
- Level 3 has some uncommitted system modifications (Obsidian auto-saves, linter changes)
- Level 1 HTML file modified by system (background color gradient change)
- Multiple untracked files (fonts, assets, legacy files)

**Git Warning:**
The local repository history has been completely rewritten and diverges from origin/master. The `--force-with-lease` flag will safely force push, but any other developers working on this repo will need to reset their local copies.
