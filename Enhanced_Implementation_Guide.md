## System Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- JavaScript enabled
- Minimum screen resolution: 1024x768
- Internet connection for AI features (optional)
- PDF viewer for plan exports

### Team Requirements

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration (30 minutes)

#### 1.1 Access the Application
1. Open the Shop Reset Kit in your web browser
2. Verify all sections load correctly (Front Window, Main Floor, etc.)
3. Test the "Show Metrics" button to ensure performance tracking works

#### 1.2 Initial Goal Setting
**Best Practices for Goals:**
- Be specific: "Winter seasonal items" vs "seasonal"
- Include metrics: "Increase high-margin product visibility by 20%"
- Consider timeframe: "Holiday season preparation" vs "general improvement"

**Example Goal Patterns:**
```
‚ùå Poor: "Make things better"
‚úÖ Good: "Focus on winter seasonal items and improve traffic flow near entrance"

‚ùå Poor: "New stuff"
‚úÖ Good: "Highlight new arrivals with cross-selling opportunities for accessories"

‚ùå Poor: "Profits"
‚úÖ Good: "Position high-margin luxury items in premium zones with 75%+ margins"
```

#### 1.3 Goal Analysis Verification
After entering goals, verify the system detects relevant patterns:
- SEASONAL: Winter, holiday, summer items
- PROFITABILITY: High-margin, premium, luxury
- NEWAPRIVALS: New, latest, fresh items
- TRAFFIC: Flow, movement, circulation
- SAFETY: Clear, accessible, compliance

### Phase 2: Plan Generation and Analysis (45 minutes)

#### 2.1 Generate Optimized Plan
1. Click "Generate Optimized Plan"
2. Review the goal analysis tags that appear
3. Examine the generated plan for:
   - Anchor product placement
   - Spoke product clustering
   - VM zone assignments (Eye Level, Stretch, Reach, Stoop)

#### 2.2 Performance Metrics Review
Enable metrics view and analyze:

**Target Benchmarks:**
- **Anchor Products**: 3-5 per store section
- **Spoke Products**: 6-12 supporting anchors
- **Eye Level Items**: 60-80% of high-priority items
- **Traffic Flow Score**: 75%+ for optimal flow
- **Cross-sell Opportunities**: 4-8 potential combinations
- **Safety Compliance**: 100% (non-negotiable)

**Color Coding:**
- üü¢ Green (80%+): Excellent performance
- üü° Yellow (60-79%): Good, room for improvement
- üî¥ Red (<60%): Needs attention

#### 2.3 VM Recommendations Analysis
Review generated recommendations for:
- **Zone Optimization**: Eye level placement guidance
- **Traffic Flow**: Customer movement patterns
- **Safety Compliance**: Clearance and accessibility
- **Cross-Merchandising**: Anchor-spoke relationships
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Timing and placement

### Phase 3: Plan Validation and Refinement (30 minutes)

#### 3.1 Visual Validation Checklist
Print or view the plan and verify:

| Element | Check | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Anchor Visibility** | Can anchors be seen from main entrance? | ‚¨ú |
| **Spoke Accessibility** | Are spokes within arm's reach of anchors? | ‚¨ú |
| **Safety Clearance** | 36-inch minimum walkway clearance? | ‚¨ú |
| **Zone Logic** | High-margin items in premium zones? | ‚¨ú |
| **Traffic Flow** | Natural right-hand movement pattern? | ‚¨ú |
| **Emergency Access** | Clear path to all exits? | ‚¨ú |

#### 3.2 Dry Run Procedure
1. **Virtual Walkthrough**: Follow the traffic flow on the plan
2. **Bottleneck Identification**: Mark potential congestion points
3. **Accessibility Check**: Verify compliance with accessibility standards
4. **Staff Efficiency**: Consider staff movement for restocking/assistance

#### 3.3 Plan Iteration
If issues are identified:
1. Adjust goals to address specific concerns
2. Regenerate plan with refined objectives
3. Compare metrics between iterations
4. Document changes and rationale

### Phase 4: Execution Preparation (45 minutes)

#### 4.1 Team Briefing
**Manager Responsibilities:**
- Review complete plan with team
- Explain anchor-and-spokes methodology
- Assign sections to team members
- Set timeline and checkpoints

**Staff Training Points:**
- Anchor products: Key high-impact items
- Spoke products: Complementary cross-sell items
- VM zones: Eye level = priority, stoop = bulk/clearance
- Customer flow: Right-hand traffic patterns

#### 4.2 Resource Preparation
**Physical Materials:**
- Printed plan (color recommended)
- Section assignment sheets
- Safety equipment (if needed)
- Measuring tools for clearances
- Cleaning supplies for prep work

**Digital Tools:**

#### 4.3 Pre-Reset Inventory
Document current state:
- Photograph existing layout
- Note current product positions
- Record baseline metrics (if available)
- Identify missing inventory or fixtures

### Phase 5: Execution and Monitoring (2-4 hours)

#### 5.1 Reset Sequence
**Recommended Order:**
1. **Safety First**: Clear walkways and emergency exits
2. **Anchor Placement**: Position key products in designated zones
3. **Spoke Clustering**: Add complementary items around anchors
4. **Zone Optimization**: Adjust heights per VM guidelines
5. **Flow Verification**: Walk customer path and adjust as needed
6. **Final Safety Check**: Verify all clearances and stability

#### 5.2 Progress Tracking
Track completion by section:
- ‚úÖ Front Window: Anchors and spokes positioned
- ‚úÖ Main Floor: High-traffic zones optimized
- ‚úÖ Side Areas: Reach zone products placed
