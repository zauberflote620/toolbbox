# Validation Loop: QA, Feedback & Iteration

This document provides the tools and processes to validate a shop reset, capture feedback, and ensure continuous improvement for future runs. It is a critical step to ensure the plan works in reality as well as it does on paper.

## 1. Visual QA Checklist

Before printing and distributing, perform this quick visual check on all artifacts (especially the Anchor & Spoke Map and Relationship Cards).

| Check | Pass/Fail | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Legibility at A4/Letter** | [ ] | Can all text be read comfortably when printed on standard paper? |
| **Color-Blind Safe Patterns** | [ ] | If using color, are there also patterns or labels to distinguish elements? (e.g., solid vs. dashed lines) |
| **Thumbnail Readability** | [ ] | Is the core information understandable when viewing the artifact as a small thumbnail on a screen? |
| **Small-Screen Readability** | [ ] | Can the artifact be reasonably interpreted on a mobile phone screen? |
| **Print Margins** | [ ] | Are there adequate margins (at least 0.5 inches) to prevent content from being cut off when printed? |

## 2. Redline Annotation Guide

Use a printed copy of the **Anchor & Spoke Map** to perform a physical walkthrough of the space (a "dry run"). Use the following standard redline marks to provide clear, actionable feedback.

**Visual Guide to Annotation:**

```
+----------------------------------------------------+
| ANNOTATION KEY                                     |
+----------------------------------------------------+
|                                                    |
|   ~~~ (Wavy Line Underneath) ~~~                   |
|   MEANING: Item feels out of place or confusing.   |
|   EXAMPLE: ~~~(S)~~~                               |
|                                                    |
|   <-- (Arrow Pointing to New Location) -->         |
|   MEANING: Move this item or section here.         |
|   EXAMPLE: (A1) --> [New Spot]                     |
|                                                    |
|   [  ] (Circle with an X)                          |
|   MEANING: Remove this item. Obstruction/Clutter.  |
|   EXAMPLE: [X]                                     |
|                                                    |
|   ? (Question Mark)                                |
|   MEANING: Why is this here? Logic is unclear.     |
|   EXAMPLE: (S)?                                    |
|                                                    |
+----------------------------------------------------+

**Hi-Fi-Ready Version (for digital feedback):**
*   Use a PDF annotation tool (like Adobe Acrobat or a browser-based one).
*   **Comments:** Use comment bubbles for detailed notes.
*   **Highlighting:** Use yellow for items that work well, red for problems.
*   **Strikethrough:** To mark items for removal.

## 3. Dry-Run Log Template

After the walkthrough, consolidate the feedback from the redlined map into this simple log. This creates a formal record for what needs to be fixed before the final reset or improved in the next run.

**Log Template (Markdown):**

```
# Dry-Run Log: <PLACEHOLDER: Date>

| Location/Artifact | Issue/Feedback | Proposed Solution | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Entrance Zone / A1 | The "complementary" spoke (a scarf) is getting lost behind the mannequin. | Move the scarf to a small bust form next to the mannequin. | High |
| Main Floor / Map | The path between the gondola (A2) and the tables feels too narrow. Violates `clear_egress_path_3ft`. | Shift the tables 6 inches to the right. | High |
| POS Area / Card | The `pos_contrast_tactic` isn't working; the packaging is still hard to see. | Add a small, focused task light on the display case. | Medium |
| Back Wall | Question mark on a spoke item. Why is a beach towel here in winter? | Swap for a seasonal item. Check inventory for a relevant "Home Goods" spoke. | Low |

```

This structured feedback loop ensures that each reset is not just executed, but also evaluated and refined, making the entire process smarter and more effective over time.
