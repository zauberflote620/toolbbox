| **Safety Compliance** | 100% | Adherence to accessibility and safety standards |

## 🎨 Anchor-and-Spokes Methodology

### Core Principles

1. **Anchor Products**: High-impact items positioned in high-traffic zones
   - Eye level placement (60-72 inches)
   - Strategic spacing (8-12 feet from entrance)
   - Clear visibility from multiple angles

2. **Spoke Products**: Complementary items clustered around anchors
   - Cross-selling opportunities
   - Logical product relationships
   - Reach zone positioning (48-60 inches)

3. **VM Zone Implementation**
   - **Stretch Zone (72+ inches)**: Premium/aspirational items
   - **Eye Level (60-72 inches)**: Bestsellers and high-margin products
   - **Reach Zone (48-60 inches)**: Everyday items and accessories
   - **Stoop Zone (Below 48 inches)**: Bulk items and clearance

4. **Traffic Flow Optimization**
   - Right-hand traffic preference
   - Clear sight lines to anchors
   - 36-inch minimum walkway clearance
   - Natural stopping points
