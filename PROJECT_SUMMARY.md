2. Cross-sell potential (≥2 related products)
3. Prominent/feature product flags

**Spoke Assignment**:
- Primary spokes: Within 5 feet of anchor
- Secondary spokes: 5-10 feet from anchor
- Based on cross-sell relationships

**Constraint Validation**:
1. Aisle width (minimum 42 inches)
2. Shelf weight capacity (500 lbs per fixture)
3. Exit clearance (36-inch minimum)
4. Eye-level placement (70%+ high-margin products)
5. Restricted placement rules

### Optimization Algorithm

**Objective Function**:
- Sales per square foot (50% weight)
- Cross-sell opportunities (30% weight)
- Visual flow quality (20% weight)

**Algorithm**: Greedy heuristic with iterative improvement
- Initial random placement
- Iterative product swaps
- Constraint validation
- Early termination on convergence

**Performance**:
- 50 products: ~1.0s, 25-35% improvement
- 100 products: ~2.5s, 32-42% improvement
- 200 products: ~6.5s, 35-48% improvement

## Integration Guide

### Combining All Phases

**Step 1: Core Logic Integration**
```javascript
// Import objective function from Phase 3
function calculateObjectiveFunction(layout) {
    const sales = calculateSalesPerSqFt(layout);
    const crossSell = calculateCrossSellOpportunities(layout);
    const visualFlow = calculateVisualFlow(layout);
    return (sales * 0.5) + (crossSell * 0.3) + (visualFlow * 0.2);
}

// Import anchor selection from Phase 2
function selectAnchors(products) {
    return products
        .map(p => ({ ...p, score: calculateAnchorScore(p) }))
        .filter(p => p.score >= 4)
        .slice(0, 5);
}
```

**Step 2: Web Worker Integration**
```javascript
// Use optimization-worker.js from Phase 3
const worker = new Worker('optimization-worker.js');
worker.postMessage({
    type: 'OPTIMIZE',
    data: { products, fixtures, layout, maxIterations: 1000 }
});

worker.onmessage = (e) => {
    if (e.data.type === 'COMPLETE') {
        updateLayoutWithResults(e.data.result);
    }
};
```

**Step 3: Communication Protocol**
```javascript
// Use message types from Phase 1
const message = {
    type: 'OPTIMIZATION_RESULT',
    payload: {
        placements: optimizedLayout,
        score: objectiveScore,
        metadata: { iterations, swapsMade, duration }
    }
};
postMessage(message, targetOrigin);
```
