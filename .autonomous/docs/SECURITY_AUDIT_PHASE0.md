# Security Audit - Phase 0

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Tool**: npm audit
**Project**: shop-reset-kit

## Summary

- **Critical**: 0
- **High**: 0 ✓ (meets requirement)
- **Moderate**: 2
- **Low**: 0

## Vulnerabilities Found

### 1. esbuild <=0.24.2 (Moderate)
- **Issue**: Enables any website to send requests to development server and read response
- **Advisory**: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
- **Impact**: Development server only, not production
- **Current Version**: Part of Vite 4.x dependency chain

### 2. vite <=6.1.6 (Moderate)
- **Issue**: Depends on vulnerable esbuild version
- **Impact**: Development server only, not production
- **Current Version**: 4.5.0

## Fix Available

```bash
npm audit fix --force
```

**Warning**: Would install vite@7.1.7, which is a BREAKING CHANGE

## Decision

**Action**: Defer fix to future phase

**Rationale**:
1. No high or critical severity vulnerabilities ✓
2. Moderate vulnerabilities affect dev server only, not production
3. Breaking change to Vite 7.x could destabilize existing codebase
4. Applying breaking changes during Phase 0 increases risk
5. MVP Success Criteria: "Zero high-severity vulnerabilities" - MET

## Recommendation for Future

- Phase 6 (Documentation): Re-evaluate and apply breaking fix if stable
- Test with Vite 7.x in isolated branch before applying
- Document any API changes required for Vite 7.x migration

## Status

**Security Requirement**: MET (zero high-severity vulnerabilities)
**Phase 0**: PROCEED with current dependency versions
