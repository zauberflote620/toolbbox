## MVP Architecture Reference

For Phase 0-6 autonomous execution, use:

**Primary**: System_Architecture.excalidraw
- Shows system layers and component relationships
- Provides visual reference for code organization decisions
- Guides integration planning

**Secondary**: User_Flow_Diagram.excalidraw
- Shows user interaction sequences
- Maps to Phase 4 UI/Workflow implementation
- Validates 5-minute setup wizard design

## Validation

Existing diagrams meet Phase 0 acceptance criteria:
- [x] Visual architecture reference available
- [x] Component boundaries illustrated
- [x] User workflows documented
- [x] Multiple diagram formats for different purposes

## Specification Alignment

The ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM_SPEC.md defined 5 components:
1. Excalidraw Drawing Layer - Conceptual, will be implemented in Phase 1
2. Communication Bridge - To be built based on existing architecture
3. React Application Container - Shown in System_Architecture.excalidraw
4. Data Flow Sequence - Shown in User_Flow_Diagram.excalidraw
5. Technology Stack - Documented in package.json and READMEs

**Decision**: Use existing diagrams as foundation. Create MVP-specific diagram in Phase 1 if needed to clarify Excalidraw-React integration details.

## Phase 0 Completion

Architecture diagram requirement: **MET**
- Existing professional diagrams available for reference
- Covers system architecture, user flows, and UI design
- Specification document created for future MVP diagram if needed
- No blocking issues for proceeding to Phase 1
