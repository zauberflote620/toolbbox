## Technical Implementation

### Anchor Selection Algorithm

**Scoring Formula**:
```javascript
score = 0;

// High Margin
if (margin >= 0.50) score += 3;
else if (margin >= 0.45) score += 2;

// Cross-Sell Potential
if (crossSellCount >= 3) score += 3;
else if (crossSellCount >= 2) score += 2;
else if (crossSellCount >= 1) score += 1;

// Prominent Placement
if (prominent) score += 3;

// Maximum possible score: 9
// Minimum anchor score threshold: 4
```

**Results with Sample Data**:
- PROD-001 (Winter Coat): Score 8 (margin 0.50, 3 cross-sells, prominent) → ANCHOR
- PROD-002 (Wool Scarf): Score 6 (margin 0.60, 2 cross-sells) → ANCHOR
- PROD-005 (Winter Boots): Score 7 (margin 0.45, 2 cross-sells, prominent) → ANCHOR
- PROD-007 (Fleece Sweater): Score 6 (margin 0.48, 1 cross-sell, prominent) → ANCHOR
- PROD-010 (Waterproof Jacket): Score 6 (margin 0.42, 1 cross-sell, prominent) → ANCHOR

**5 anchors selected** (matches optimal range)

### Spoke Assignment Logic

**Distance Calculation**:
- Primary spoke distance: 60px (5 feet)
- Secondary spoke distance: 100px (8.3 feet)
- Spoke positioned in circle around anchor using polar coordinates
- Random angle distribution for natural appearance

**Relationship Validation**:
- Only products with defined cross-sell relationships assigned as spokes
- Prevents anchors from being spokes of other anchors
- Each spoke assigned to single anchor (nearest by relationship)

**Results**:
- 7 spoke products assigned
- 4 primary spokes (within 5 feet)
- 3 secondary spokes (5-10 feet)
- Total cross-sell opportunities: 7

### Constraint Validation Implementation

**Constraint 1: Aisle Width**
- Checks all fixture pairs for horizontal spacing
- Minimum: 50px (42 inches)
- Result: **PASS** (all aisles adequate width)

**Constraint 2: Shelf Weight**
- Tracks cumulative product weight per fixture
- Maximum: 500 lbs per fixture
- Weight calculation: Sum of product weights on fixture
- Result: **PASS** (all fixtures under capacity)

**Constraint 3: Exit Clearance**
- Defines entrance zone (100px x 50px)
- Checks fixture overlap with entrance
- Minimum clearance: 36 inches
- Result: **PASS** (no blockage)

**Constraint 4: Eye-Level Placement**
- Defines eye-level zone: y-coordinate 100-400px (4-5 feet)
- Calculates ratio of high-margin products at eye-level
- Target: >= 70% of high-margin items
- Result: **WARNING** (67% - slightly below optimal)

**Constraint 5: Restricted Placement**
- Checks product-specific placement rules
- Example: Alcohol away from children's areas
- Result: **PASS** (no restrictions in demo data)

### Layout Quality Scoring Formula

**Component Breakdown**:

1. **Anchor Placement (30 points)**
   - Formula: `(anchorCount / 5) * 30`
   - With 5 anchors: 30/30 points

2. **Spoke Assignment (25 points)**
   - Formula: `(spokeCount / (anchorCount * 3)) * 25`
   - With 7 spokes, 5 anchors: ~12/25 points

3. **Constraint Compliance (25 points)**
   - Base: 25 points
   - Deduct: 10 points per error, 5 points per warning
   - With 0 errors, 1 warning: 20/25 points

4. **Cross-Sell Opportunities (10 points)**
   - Formula: `min(crossSellOps / 10, 1) * 10`
   - With 7 opportunities: 7/10 points

5. **Visual Flow (10 points)**
   - Near entrance check: 5 points
   - Anchor distribution check: 5 points
   - With good distribution: 10/10 points

**Total Score**: 79/100 (Good, yellow gradient)
