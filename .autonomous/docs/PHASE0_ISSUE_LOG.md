# Phase 0 Issue Log

## Issue #1: npm install timeout

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Severity**: Moderate
**Status**: Workaround Applied

### Problem

npm install repeatedly times out (>2 minutes) when attempting to install dependencies in shop-reset-kit directory:
- First attempt: timeout after 2m
- Second attempt (after rm -rf node_modules): timeout after 3m
- node_modules directory exists but is incomplete
- vite, vitest, react packages not present in node_modules

### Impact

- Cannot run full test suite validation in Phase 0
- Test framework validation deferred to Phase 1

### Investigation

```bash
# Confirmed vitest is available globally via npx
npx vitest --version
# Output: vitest/3.2.4

# But cannot find vite package locally
ls node_modules | grep vite
# Output: (empty)
```

### Root Cause (Hypothesis)

Possible causes:
1. Network issues causing slow/incomplete package downloads
2. Large dependency tree requiring longer installation time
3. File system performance on external drive
4. Package registry connectivity issues

### Workaround Applied

**Decision**: Simplification Trigger Activated

Per SCOPE_DEFINITION.md simplification protocol:
- Defer full test framework validation to Phase 1
- Validate that vitest is available via npx (confirmed ✓)
- Proceed with Phase 0 core objectives (git, docs, architecture)
- Re-attempt dependency installation at start of Phase 1

### Time Impact

- Time spent on npm install attempts: ~25 minutes
- Original Phase 0 allocation: 3.5 hours
- Remaining time budget: ~3 hours for remaining tasks

### Recovery Plan

**Phase 1 Start**:
1. Retry npm install with increased timeout (5 minutes)
2. If still failing, try alternative approaches:
   - Use npm ci instead of npm install
   - Try pnpm or yarn instead
   - Install packages individually starting with vite
   - Check network connectivity and npm registry status

**Fallback**:
- If dependency installation continues to fail, consider simplification:
  - Use standalone React app without Vite build system
  - Manual script inclusion instead of bundler
  - Focus on core functionality over build optimization

### Verification Status

- [x] Git initialized and working
- [x] .gitignore created
- [x] Autonomous directory structure created
- [x] Documentation artifacts created
- [x] Security audit run (0 high-severity vulns)
- [x] vitest available via npx
- [ ] **DEFERRED**: Full test suite execution
- [ ] **DEFERRED**: vite dev server validation

### Phase 0 Completion Criteria Impact

Original criteria:
- Git repository initialized ✓
- Dependencies installed ⚠️ (partially - npx access confirmed)
- Test framework running with sample test ⚠️ (deferred to Phase 1)
- Excalidraw architecture diagram (in progress)
- Checkpoint script tested (pending)

**Decision**: Proceed with Phase 0 completion despite test framework deferral. Critical infrastructure (git, docs, architecture) takes priority. Test framework will be validated in Phase 1 before any code implementation begins.
