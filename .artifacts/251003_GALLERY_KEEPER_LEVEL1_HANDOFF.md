- Visitors enter with preferences (visible color/style auras)
- Rearrange artworks to satisfy visitor preferences
- Harmony scoring based on matching preferences
- Victory: Satisfy 20 visitors

**Educational Goal**: Teaches how AI optimizes for multiple constraints simultaneously (like recommendation systems balancing user preferences, content diversity, and business goals)

### Phase 3 Deliverables (6 hours allocated)

1. **Bach Tutorial System** (45 min)
   - 5-step tutorial explaining arrangement mechanics
   - Bach spirit NPC with musical chimes

## üîß Technical Decisions Log

### Visual Style (Established)
- **Background**: Dark museum gray (#2C3E50) - maintains focus on sprites
- **Sprites**: Modern hand-drawn with shadows and idle animations
- **Destinations**: Clean circles with icons, no text labels (icon matching only)
- **Movement**: Natural drift + downward walk, visitors move over destinations
- **No sprite backgrounds**: Transparent, clean visual separation

### Gameplay Patterns (Established)
- **Tutorial**: Spirit NPC with message bubbles, click to advance
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Spawn speed increases, multi-spawn waves
- **Failure Condition**: Screen fills up (too many entities)
- **Victory**: Fixed goal (serve X visitors/satisfy X visitors)
- **Scoring**: Base + time bonus + combo multipliers

### Code Patterns (Established)
- **Level Structure**:
  - Constructor: Initialize state, data, NPCs
  - `init()`: Set up entities, start tutorial
  - `update(dt)`: Game logic, spawning, victory/failure checks
  - `render(ctx)`: Custom level visuals (doors, NPCs, UI)
  - Event handlers: `onDragEnd()`, etc.

- **Entity Pattern**:
  ```javascript
  const entity = {
      x, y, width, height,
      update: (dt) => {},
      render: (ctx) => {}
  };
  engine.addEntity(entity);
  ```

- **Sprite Factory Pattern**:
  ```javascript
  const visitor = ModernSpriteFactory.createVisitor(x, y, type);
  // Override update/render for custom behavior
  ```

## üö® Important Learnings & Patterns

### What Works Well
- **Clean visual design**: No text labels, icon-only matching
- **Progressive difficulty**: Speeds up naturally, wave mode adds urgency
- **Natural movement**: Drift + downward walk feels realistic
- **Tutorial pacing**: Click-to-advance, short messages
- **Failure pressure**: Screen fills up creates urgency without frustration

### What to Replicate in Level 2
- Clean circular markers for destinations (wall grid cells)
- Icon-based matching (preference icons above visitors)
- Natural movement patterns (visitors walk through gallery)
- Spirit NPC tutorial system (Bach appears at milestones)
- Progressive difficulty (more visitors, complex preferences)

### What NOT to Do
- ‚ùå Don't add text labels on interactive elements (icons only)
- ‚ùå Don't stop entity movement unnaturally (let them move over things)
- ‚ùå Don't add shadows under every element (only sprites need shadows)
- ‚ùå Don't make spawn intervals too long (start fast, get faster)
- ‚ùå Don't wait too long for wave mode (activate early for engagement)

## üéÆ Level 2 Design Details

### Artwork System

**Artwork Types** (20 pieces):
- **Styles**: Classical, Modern, Abstract, Portrait, Landscape
- **Colors**: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple, Neutral

**Visual Representation**:
```javascript
// Clean artwork sprite (similar to doors)
- Rectangular frame (80x100px)
- Colored mat/border indicating color category
- Style icon in center (üé≠ classical, üî≤ abstract, üåÑ landscape, etc.)
- Shadow underneath
- No text labels
```

**Data Structure**:
```javascript
const artwork = {
    id: 'art_001',
    style: 'classical',
    color: 'blue',
    icon: 'üé≠',
    gridX: 0,
    gridY: 0
};
```

### Visitor Preference System

**Preference Auras**:
- Colored glow around visitor (indicates color preference)
- Style icon floating above head (indicates style preference)
- Satisfaction meter (fills when preferences matched)

**Matching Logic**:
```javascript
// Score calculation
const colorMatch = artwork.color === visitor.preferredColor ? 50 : 0;
const styleMatch = artwork.style === visitor.preferredStyle ? 50 : 0;
const satisfaction = colorMatch + styleMatch; // 0, 50, or 100
```

### Grid System

**Grid Layout**:
- 6 columns √ó 4 rows = 24 slots
- Start with 20 artworks placed randomly
- 4 empty slots for rearranging

**Snap Logic**:
```javascript
const gridCellWidth = 120;
const gridCellHeight = 140;
const gridX = Math.floor(mouseX / gridCellWidth);
const gridY = Math.floor(mouseY / gridCellHeight);
const snapX = gridX * gridCellWidth + gridCellWidth/2;
const snapY = gridY * gridCellHeight + gridCellHeight/2;
```

**Visual Grid**:
- Show grid lines when dragging artwork
- Highlight target cell on hover
- Smooth snap animation (ease to position)

### Bach Tutorial Flow

**Tutorial Steps**:
1. "Welcome! I'm Johann Sebastian Bach, master of harmony."
2. "In music, every note must work together. In this gallery, every artwork must please visitors."
3. "Visitors show their preferences with colored glows and style icons."
4. "Drag artworks to new positions to match what visitors want."
5. "Satisfy 20 visitors to master the art of arrangement!"

**Bach Appearances**:
- Every 5 visitors satisfied: Encouraging message
- Uses musical terminology ("Harmony achieved!", "Perfect composition!")
- Final message: "You understand optimization! This is how AI balances multiple goals."

## üí° Design Philosophy (Do Not Compromise)

### Core Principles
- **Cozy, not challenging** - Relaxing optimization, not stressful puzzle
- **Show, don't tell** - Learn by doing, not reading instructions
- **Can't fail, only optimize** - No wrong answers, just better arrangements
- **Learning invisible** - AI concepts emerge through gameplay
- **Icons over text** - Visual matching, minimal reading

### Level 2 Specific
- **Multiple constraints** = Real AI optimization (color AND style preferences)
- **Rearrangement** = Iterative improvement (like ML training loops)
- **Visitor satisfaction** = Multi-stakeholder optimization
- **Bach's harmony** = Balance and composition (AI balancing trade-offs)
