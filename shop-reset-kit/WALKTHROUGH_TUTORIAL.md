## What Is This Tool?

### In Simple Terms

Imagine you own a clothing store. You have:
- **Racks and shelves** (we call these "fixtures")
- **Products** (clothes, accessories, etc.)
- **A goal**: Make more sales!

This tool helps you figure out **where to put each product** so that:
- Customers see the best items first
- Related products are near each other (like scarves near coats)
- Your store looks organized and inviting
- You make more money!

### The Magic Behind It

The tool uses something called the **"Anchor-and-Spokes"** method. Think of it like this:

**Anchors** = Your star products (the big coat everyone wants)
- These go in the best spots where customers will definitely see them
- Like putting the coolest toy in the front of a toy store window

**Spokes** = Products that go well with the anchors (scarves, gloves, hats)
- These go near the anchors
- Like putting batteries next to the toy that needs batteries

**Why this works**: When customers come in to buy the big coat, they also see the matching scarf right next to it, and boom! They buy both.

---

## What You'll Need

### Required
- **A computer** (Mac, Windows, or Linux - doesn't matter!)
- **A web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- **5 minutes** of your time

### Optional
- **Your product list** in a spreadsheet (CSV file)
  - If you don't have one, no worries! We have sample products to practice with
- **A cup of coffee** ☕ (this is easy and fun!)

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Find the Application File

1. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the Shop Reset Toolbox
2. Look for the folder called `shop-reset-kit`
3. Inside, find a file called **`integrated-app.html`**

**What does it look like?**
- The file icon will look like a web browser icon (Chrome, Safari, etc.)
- The name ends in `.html`

### Step 2: Open the Application

**Method 1: Double-Click** (Easiest)
- Simply double-click the `integrated-app.html` file
- Your default web browser will open automatically
- The application starts right away!

**Method 2: Right-Click** (If double-click doesn't work)
- Right-click on `integrated-app.html`
- Choose "Open With"
- Select your web browser (Chrome recommended)

**Method 3: Drag and Drop**
- Open your web browser first
- Drag the `integrated-app.html` file into the browser window
- Drop it, and it opens!

### Step 3: Wait for It to Load

- The app should load in **less than 2 seconds**
- You'll see a purple gradient background (pretty!)
- A welcome screen appears with a wizard

**If it doesn't load:**
- Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Try a different browser (Chrome works best)
- See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below

### Part 1: The Setup Wizard (2 minutes)

When you first open the app, you'll see a **Setup Wizard**. This is like a helpful guide that asks you three simple questions.

#### Screen 1: Welcome

**What you see:**
```

#### Screen 3: Choose Your Store Size

**What you see:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   Store Layout                  │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│                                 │

│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What are "fixtures"?**
- Fixtures are your racks, shelves, display tables, and endcaps
- Basically, anywhere you can put products
- Count them in your store to know which option to pick

**What to do:**

**For Your First Time** (Recommended):
1. Click **"Medium Store (6-10 fixtures)"**
2. The box will turn blue/highlighted
3. Click **"Complete Setup"**

**Choosing the Right Size:**
- **Small Store**: Perfect if you have 3-5 racks/shelves
  - Example: Small boutique, pop-up shop
- **Medium Store**: Good for 6-10 racks/shelves
  - Example: Standard retail store
- **Large Store**: For 11+ racks/shelves
  - Example: Department store, large format store

**What happens next:**
- The wizard disappears (you're done with setup!)
- The main application appears
- Your sample products are already loaded
- Your store fixtures are ready to use

**Time to celebrate!** 🎉 You just completed the setup!

- We'll use these at the end!

---

### Part 3: Viewing Your Products (2 minutes)

Let's look at what products you have!

#### Looking at the Product List

**In the sidebar**, scroll through the products:

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Winter Coat 1            │
│ PROD-001 | $199.99 | 50% │ ← Name, SKU, Price, Margin
└──────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Wool Scarf 2             │
│ PROD-002 | $29.99 | 60%  │
└──────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Winter Boots 5           │
│ PROD-005 | $149.99 | 45% │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

**What does each number mean?**

- **Name**: What the product is called
  - Example: "Winter Coat 1"

- **SKU**: A unique code for each product
  - Example: "PROD-001"
  - Think of it like a product ID number

- **Price**: How much it costs
  - Example: $199.99

- **Margin**: How much profit you make
  - Example: 50% means if it costs you $100, you sell for $200
  - Higher margin = more profit for you!

**Try This:**
- Scroll through all 50 products
- Notice the variety: coats, scarves, boots, accessories
- See how prices range from $29 to $200
- Notice margins from 30% to 60%

---

### Part 4: Understanding the Store Layout (2 minutes)

Now let's look at the canvas (the main area showing your store).

#### What You See

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│  [Entrance]  ← Orange box           │
│                                     │
│  ┌─────┐  ┌─────┐  ┌─────┐        │
│  │ F1  │  │ F2  │  │ F5  │        │ ← Fixtures (blue boxes)
│  └─────┘  └─────┘  └─────┘        │
│                                     │
│  ┌─────┐  ┌─────┐                 │
│  │ F3  │  │ F4  │                 │
│  └─────┘  └─────┘                 │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The Entrance:**
- The **orange box** at the top
- This is where customers walk in
- Important! Customers see things near the entrance first

**The Fixtures:**
- Each **blue box** is a fixture (F1, F2, F3, etc.)
- In real life, these are your:
  - Wall shelves
  - Display tables
  - Clothing racks
  - Endcaps

**Traffic Zones:**
- **High-traffic** (near entrance): F1, F2
  - Customers definitely see these
  - Best place for important products!

- **Medium-traffic** (middle): F3, F4
  - Customers usually see these
  - Good for complementary products

- **Low-traffic** (back): F5
  - Only some customers go here
  - Okay for bulk items or less important products

**Why This Matters:**
- Products near the entrance (F1, F2) get seen more
- The tool will help put your best products there
- This is how you make more sales!

---

### Part 5: The Magic - Running Optimization! (3 minutes)

This is where the tool does its magic! Let's optimize your store layout.

#### Before We Start

**Current State:**
- Right now, products might not be placed on fixtures yet
- Or they might be randomly placed
- Either way, we can make it better!

#### Running the Optimization

**Step 1: Click the Button**

Find the big button that says **"Run Optimization"**
- It's in the toolbar at the top
- Or you can click "Optimize" in the header
- Either button does the same thing!

**What happens when you click:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Running optimization...            │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│  ████████████░░░░░░░░░░  60%       │ ← Progress bar
│                                     │
│  Iteration 120 (Score: 2456)       │ ← What it's doing
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What's happening behind the scenes:**
1. The tool is trying different product placements
2. For each arrangement, it calculates a "score"
3. It keeps trying to find better scores
4. It stops when it finds the best arrangement

**How long does it take?**
- With 50 products: About **1-2 seconds**
- With 200 products: About **6-7 seconds**
- Pretty fast! ⚡

#### Understanding the Progress

While it's running, you'll see:

- **Progress Bar**: Shows how close to done (0% → 100%)
- **Iteration Number**: How many tries it's made
- **Current Score**: The quality of the current arrangement
  - Higher score = better placement!

**Just wait!** Don't click anything else. It'll finish quickly.

---

#### After Optimization Completes

**What you'll see:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✓ Optimization complete!           │
│  Products distributed across         │
│  fixtures.                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**On the canvas:**
- All fixtures now have colored dots (products!)
- Green dots = Your best products
- Orange dots = Medium-value products
- Red dots = Lower-value products

**What the tool did:**
1. **Found your "anchor" products** (high-margin, popular items)
2. **Placed them in high-traffic zones** (near entrance)
3. **Found "spoke" products** (items that go well with anchors)
4. **Placed spokes near their anchors**
5. **Optimized for maximum sales!**

#### Example of What Changed

**Before Optimization:**
```
F1 (near entrance): Random products
F2 (near entrance): Random products
F5 (back of store): Random products
```

**After Optimization:**
```
F1 (near entrance): Winter Coat (anchor) + Scarf (spoke)
F2 (near entrance): Boots (anchor) + Gloves (spoke)
F5 (back of store): Bulk items, clearance
```

**Why this is better:**
- Best-selling coats are where customers see them first!
- Matching scarves are right next to the coats
- When someone buys a coat, they'll likely grab the scarf too
- More sales! 💰

---

### Part 6: Understanding Your Results (5 minutes)

Now let's understand what the optimization achieved!

#### The Improvement Percentage

After optimization, you'll see something like:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Objective Score        │
│      1,234              │ ← Your new score
│  +35% improvement       │ ← How much better!
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**What does this mean?**

- **Objective Score**: A number representing how good your layout is
  - Higher = Better!
  - It's calculated from sales potential, cross-selling, and flow

- **+35% improvement**: Your layout is 35% better than random!
  - This could translate to 35% more sales potential
  - That's huge! 🎉

**Typical improvements:**
- Most stores see 25-40% improvement
- Some see even more!
- It depends on your products and store size

#### Understanding the Metrics

You'll see several metrics displayed:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Objective Score: 1,234  [+35%]         │
│  Iterations: 156                        │
│  Swaps Made: 42                         │
│  Time: 1.2s                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Breaking it down:**

1. **Objective Score: 1,234**
   - The overall quality of your layout
   - Higher is better
   - Don't worry about the exact number, focus on the improvement %

2. **Iterations: 156**
   - How many times the tool tried different arrangements
   - More iterations usually means better results
   - The tool stops when it can't improve anymore

3. **Swaps Made: 42**
   - How many times products were moved between fixtures
   - Shows how much the tool changed your layout

4. **Time: 1.2s**
   - How long the optimization took
   - Should be very fast (under 10 seconds)

#### The Three Components

The tool optimizes three things:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Objective Function Components          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Sales per Square Foot        456       │ ← (50% weight)
│  Cross-Sell Opportunities     234       │ ← (30% weight)
│  Visual Flow Quality          178       │ ← (20% weight)
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**1. Sales per Square Foot**
- Measures: How much revenue each fixture generates
- Goal: Put high-value products in high-traffic areas
- Example: $200 coat near entrance = high sales per sq ft

**2. Cross-Sell Opportunities**
- Measures: How many related products are near each other
- Goal: Make it easy for customers to buy multiple items
- Example: Scarf next to coat = cross-sell opportunity

**3. Visual Flow Quality**
- Measures: How well the layout guides customers through the store
- Goal: Natural, logical flow from entrance to all areas
- Example: Entrance → Coats → Accessories → Checkout

**The weights:**
- Sales = 50% (most important!)
- Cross-Sell = 30% (very important)
- Visual Flow = 20% (important for experience)

└───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Color Code:**
- **Green dots** (●): High-value products
  - These are your money-makers!
  - Notice they're mostly in F1 and F2 (near entrance)

- **Orange dots** (●): Medium-value products
  - Good sellers, but not the top tier
  - Placed in medium-traffic areas

- **Red dots** (●): Lower-value products
  - Still important, but not the focus
  - Often in the back (F5)

#### What Makes a Good Layout?

The tool created a good layout if you see:

**✅ High-value products near the entrance**
```
F1 (near entrance): Lots of green dots
F2 (near entrance): Lots of green dots
```

**✅ Related products together**
```
F1: Winter Coats + Scarves nearby
F2: Boots + Gloves nearby
```

**✅ Natural flow**
```
Entrance → See best products first →
Walk deeper → See complementary items →
Continue to back → See clearance/bulk items
```

**✅ Balanced distribution**
```
Each fixture has products (not empty or overcrowded)
Products spread across all fixtures
No fixture is overloaded
```

#### Hovering Over Products (If Interactive)

Some versions let you hover over dots to see details:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Winter Coat 1           │
│ PROD-001                │
│ $199.99                 │
│ Margin: 50%             │
│ Fixture: F1             │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

This helps you identify which specific products are where!

### Part 8: Making Manual Adjustments (Optional - 5 minutes)

Maybe you want to change something manually. No problem!

#### Drag and Drop Products

You can move products by hand if you want!

**Step 1: Find a Product in the Sidebar**
- Scroll through the product list on the left
- Pick one you want to move

**Step 2: Click and Hold**
- Click on the product card
- Hold the mouse button down
- The card will look slightly faded (dragging state)

**Step 3: Drag to a Fixture**
- While holding, move your mouse to the canvas
- Hover over a fixture (F1, F2, etc.)
- The fixture might highlight

**Step 4: Drop It**
- Release the mouse button
- The product is now on that fixture!

**Visual Feedback:**
```
Before:
Product on F1: ●●●●●
Product on F3: ●●

After dragging from F1 to F3:
Product on F1: ●●●●  (one less)
Product on F3: ●●●   (one more)
```

**Why would you do this?**
- Maybe you know a product sells better in a specific spot
- Maybe you have physical constraints (like a pillar) the tool doesn't know about
- Maybe you just want to experiment!

**Remember:**
- You can always click "Run Optimization" again to redo it
- Or click "Reset" to start fresh

- You can combine them in a Word document if needed!

---

### Part 10: Importing Your Own Products (Advanced - 10 minutes)

Ready to use your own products? Let's import them!

#### Preparing Your CSV File

**Step 1: Open Excel or Google Sheets**

Create a new spreadsheet with these exact column names:

```
sku | name | category | price | cost | weight | salesVelocity
```

**Important:**
- Column names must match EXACTLY (case-sensitive!)
- Don't add extra spaces
- Don't change the order (though the tool is flexible)

**Step 2: Fill in Your Data**

Here's what each column means:

1. **sku**: Unique product code
   - Example: "COAT-001", "SCRF-002"
   - Must be unique (no duplicates!)
   - Can be letters, numbers, or dashes

2. **name**: Product name
   - Example: "Men's Winter Coat - Black"
   - Can be anything descriptive
   - Keep it under 50 characters for best display

3. **category**: Product category
   - Example: "Outerwear", "Accessories", "Footwear"
   - Groups similar products together
   - Use consistent names (not "Shoes" and "Footwear")

4. **price**: Selling price
   - Example: 199.99
   - Just the number, no dollar sign!
   - Use decimals (99.99, not 99)

5. **cost**: What you paid for it
   - Example: 80.00
   - The tool calculates margin automatically
   - Must be less than price!

6. **weight**: Product weight in pounds
   - Example: 3.5
   - Used to check fixture weight limits
   - Best guess is fine if you don't know exact weight

7. **salesVelocity**: How many you sell per month
   - Example: 45
   - Just a whole number
   - Higher = more popular product

**Step 3: Sample Data**

Here's an example with 3 products:

```csv
sku,name,category,price,cost,weight,salesVelocity
COAT-001,Men's Winter Coat,Outerwear,199.99,80.00,3.5,45
SCRF-001,Wool Scarf,Accessories,29.99,12.00,0.5,75
BOOT-001,Winter Boots,Footwear,149.99,80.00,2.5,50
```

**Step 4: Save as CSV**

In Excel:
1. Click "File" → "Save As"
2. Choose "CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)" as file type
3. Name it something like "my-products.csv"
4. Click "Save"

In Google Sheets:
1. Click "File" → "Download" → "Comma-separated values (.csv)"
2. Rename the downloaded file if needed

---

#### Importing the CSV

**Step 1: Click Import**

In the app, click **"Import CSV"** button in the toolbar

**Step 2: Choose Your File**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Import Products                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│  Upload a CSV file with columns:    │
│                                     │
│  sku, name, category, price,        │
│  cost, weight, salesVelocity        │
│                                     │
│       [Choose CSV File]             │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Click "Choose CSV File" and select your file

**Step 3: Wait for Validation**

The tool will check your file:

**If successful:**
```
✓ Imported 50 products successfully!
```

**If there's an error:**
```
✗ Missing required columns: salesVelocity
```

**Common errors and fixes:**

1. **"Missing required columns: X"**
   - You forgot a column or misspelled it
   - Open your CSV and check column names
   - Make sure they match exactly: sku, name, category, price, cost, weight, salesVelocity

2. **"Invalid data in row 5"**
   - Row 5 has bad data (maybe price isn't a number)
   - Check that row in your CSV
   - Make sure numbers don't have letters or symbols

3. **"Duplicate SKU: COAT-001"**
   - You used the same SKU twice
   - Each product needs a unique SKU
   - Add numbers: COAT-001, COAT-002, etc.

**Step 4: Verify Import**

After successful import:
1. Look at the sidebar - you should see your products!
2. Check the count: "Products (50)" or however many you imported
3. Scroll through to make sure they look right

### Part 11: Adding Products Manually (5 minutes)

Want to add just one or two products? You don't need a CSV!

#### Using the Add Product Form

**Step 1: Click "Add Product"**

In the toolbar, click the **"Add Product"** button

**Step 2: Fill Out the Form**

You'll see a form popup:

```

## Understanding Your Results

Now that you've run optimization and exported your data, let's understand what it all means!

### What the Numbers Mean

#### Your Objective Score

```
Objective Score: 1,234
+35% improvement
```

**Translation:**
- Before: Random placement = score 915
- After: Optimized placement = score 1,234
- Improvement: 35% better layout!

**What this could mean for your business:**
- Potentially 35% more sales per square foot
- Better customer experience
- More cross-selling
- Higher profit

**Reality check:**
- These are estimates based on mathematical optimization
- Real-world results depend on many factors
- But the fundamentals are sound!
- Most retailers see 15-25% actual improvement

#### The Three Components

Let's break down what each component means in real terms:

**1. Sales per Square Foot (50% weight)**

```
Sales Score: 456
```

**What it measures:**
- Revenue potential per fixture
- High-value products in high-traffic areas

**Example:**
- Bad: $200 coat in the back corner (F5, low traffic)
- Good: $200 coat near entrance (F1, high traffic)

**Why 50% weight:**
- Sales are the most important metric
- Higher sales = more revenue
- This is your primary goal!

**2. Cross-Sell Opportunities (30% weight)**

```
Cross-Sell Score: 234
```

**What it measures:**
- How many related products are near each other
- Impulse buy potential

**Example:**
- Bad: Coats on F1, scarves on F5 (far apart)
- Good: Coats on F1, scarves on F1 (next to each other)

**Why 30% weight:**
- Cross-selling significantly boosts basket size
- Easy to implement
- Big impact on profit

**3. Visual Flow (20% weight)**

```
Visual Flow Score: 178
```

**What it measures:**
- How well customers navigate your store
- Logical product progression
- Category distribution

**Example:**
- Bad: Entrance → random products → exit
- Good: Entrance → feature items → complementary items → basics → exit

**Why 20% weight:**
- Good flow keeps customers in store longer
- Improves shopping experience
- Encourages exploration

---

### Interpreting Your Layout

#### Good Layout Indicators

**✅ Anchor Products Near Entrance**

Look at F1 and F2 (nearest to entrance):
- Should have mostly **green dots** (high-value)
- These are your "anchor" products
- The tool identified them based on:
  - High margin (50%+)
  - Cross-sell potential
  - Prominence flags

**Example:**
```
F1: ●●●●● (5 green dots) ← Winter coats, $200 each
F2: ●●●●● (5 green dots) ← Boots, $150 each
```

**✅ Spoke Products Near Anchors**

Look around the anchors:
- Should have **orange dots** (medium-value) nearby
- These are "spoke" products
- They complement the anchors

**Example:**
```
F1: Winter coats (anchors)
    + Scarves (spokes, go with coats)
    + Gloves (spokes, go with coats)
```

**✅ Balanced Distribution**

Each fixture should have products:
- Not too many (overcrowded)
- Not too few (empty space)

**Good:**
```
F1: 8 products ●●●●●●●●
F2: 7 products ●●●●●●●
F3: 9 products ●●●●●●●●●
F4: 8 products ●●●●●●●●
F5: 6 products ●●●●●●
```

**Bad:**
```
F1: 20 products (too crowded!)
F2: 15 products
F3: 2 products (nearly empty)
F4: 1 product
F5: 0 products (empty!)
```

---

## Advanced Features

### Understanding Constraints

The tool checks several "constraints" (rules) to make sure your layout is safe and practical.

#### The 5 Constraints

**1. Aisle Width (Min 42 inches)**
```
Status: ✓ PASS
All aisles meet minimum width
```

**What it checks:**
- Space between fixtures
- Minimum 42 inches for customer walkways
- ADA (disability access) compliance

**Why it matters:**
- Customers need room to walk
- Wheelchair accessibility
- Fire code requirements
- Legal requirement in most areas

**2. Shelf Weight Capacity (500 lbs max)**
```
Status: ✓ PASS
All fixtures under weight limit
```

**What it checks:**
- Total weight of products on each fixture
- Maximum 500 lbs per fixture (standard retail)

**Why it matters:**
- Safety! Fixtures can collapse if overloaded
- Product damage risk
- Liability concerns

**Example:**
```
F1: 15 products × 3 lbs each = 45 lbs ✓
F2: 8 products × 4 lbs each = 32 lbs ✓
```

**3. Exit Clearance (36 inch minimum)**
```
Status: ✓ PASS
Entrance area clear
```

**What it checks:**
- Nothing blocks the entrance
- Minimum 36-inch clearance from entrance

**Why it matters:**
- Fire code requirement
- Customer flow
- Emergency exit access

**4. Eye-Level Placement (70% target)**
```
Status: ⚠ WARNING
67% of high-margin products at eye level
```

**What it checks:**
- Percentage of high-value products at eye level
- Eye level = 4-5 feet high on fixtures
- Target: 70%+ of high-margin items

**Why it matters:**
- Eye level = eye level sells!
- Customers see these products first
- Research shows 35% higher sales for eye-level items

**What to do if warning:**
- The tool still works fine!
- Manual adjustment might help
- Consider adding more fixtures at eye level

**5. Restricted Placement**
```
Status: ✓ PASS
No placement restrictions violated
```

**What it checks:**
- Product-specific rules
- Example: Keep alcohol away from children's section
- Example: Keep fragile items off high shelves

**Why it matters:**
- Legal compliance
- Safety
- Common sense retail practices

How fast should things be? Here's what to expect:

| Operation | Products | Expected Time | What You'll See |
|-----------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Load App | Any | <2 seconds | Purple screen appears |
| Generate Products | 50 | <1 second | Products appear in sidebar |
| Generate Products | 200 | <2 seconds | Products appear in sidebar |
| Run Optimization | 50 | 1-2 seconds | Progress bar, then complete |
| Run Optimization | 200 | 6-8 seconds | Progress bar, then complete |
| Export PNG | Any | <1 second | File downloads |
| Export CSV | Any | <1 second | File downloads |

**If it's slower:**
- Close other browser tabs
- Restart your browser
- Check your computer isn't running too many programs
- See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section

---

### Web Worker (Behind the Scenes)

For datasets over 75 products, the tool uses something cool called a "Web Worker"!

**What's a Web Worker?**
- Think of it like hiring a helper
- The helper does the optimization in the background
- Your main browser stays responsive
- You can still scroll, click, etc.

**How it works:**

**Without Web Worker (small datasets):**
```
Browser: "I'm optimizing... please wait..."
You: [Can't do anything until it's done]
```

**With Web Worker (large datasets):**
```
Browser: "I hired a helper to optimize!"
Helper: [Working in background]
You: [Can still use the browser, see progress updates]
```

**When it activates:**
- Automatically when you have >75 products
- You don't need to do anything
- It just makes things faster and smoother!

**Progress updates:**
```
Iteration 50 (Score: 1,234)
Iteration 100 (Score: 1,567)
Iteration 150 (Score: 1,789)
Complete! Final score: 1,834
```

#### Issue 2: CSV Import Fails

**Symptoms:**
- "Missing required columns" error
- "Invalid data" error
- Import button doesn't work

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Check Column Names**

Your CSV must have EXACTLY these columns:
```
sku,name,category,price,cost,weight,salesVelocity
```

Common mistakes:
- ❌ `SKU` (uppercase) → ✅ `sku` (lowercase)
- ❌ `sales_velocity` (underscore) → ✅ `salesVelocity` (camelCase)
- ❌ Extra spaces → ✅ No spaces

**Solution 2: Check Data Types**

- Price should be: `199.99` not `$199.99`
- Cost should be: `80.00` not `$80`
- Weight should be: `3.5` not `3.5 lbs`
- Sales Velocity should be: `45` not `45 units`

**Solution 3: Check for Empty Rows**

- Remove any blank rows
- Make sure every product has all columns filled
- No empty cells!

**Solution 4: Try Sample Data First**

If you keep having trouble:
1. Download our sample CSV (create one with the format above)
2. Try importing that
3. If it works, compare it to your CSV
4. Find what's different

---

#### Issue 3: Optimization Takes Forever

**Symptoms:**
- Progress bar stuck at same percentage
- More than 30 seconds elapsed
- Browser becomes unresponsive

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Reduce Product Count**

If you have 500+ products:
1. Start with fewer products
2. Try 100 products first
3. Make sure it works
4. Then try more

**Solution 2: Close Other Tabs**

- Close all other browser tabs
- Close other programs
- Give your computer more resources

**Solution 3: Refresh and Try Again**

1. Refresh the page (F5)
2. Go through wizard again
3. Try optimization again
4. Sometimes it just needed a restart!

**Solution 4: Use a Better Computer**

- Very old computers might struggle with 200+ products
- Try on a newer computer if available
- Or use fewer products

---

#### Issue 4: Drag and Drop Doesn't Work

**Symptoms:**
- Can't drag products
- Products don't move when dropped
- No visual feedback

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Check Browser Compatibility**

- Use Chrome, Firefox, or Edge (modern versions)
- Safari works but can be finicky
- Internet Explorer does NOT work (too old!)

**Solution 2: Try Click and Drag Slowly**

1. Click on a product in the sidebar
2. Hold the mouse button down
3. Drag slowly to the canvas
4. Make sure you're over a fixture
5. Release

**Solution 3: Use Optimization Instead**

**Q: Does this work on Mac and Windows?**
**A:** Yes! Works on any computer with a modern web browser.

**Q: Can I use this on my phone or tablet?**
**A:** Yes! The design is responsive. But desktop/laptop recommended for best experience.

---

### About Optimization

**Q: How does the optimization work?**
**A:** It uses a "greedy heuristic" algorithm. It tries different product arrangements and keeps the best one. Like solving a puzzle!

**Q: Can I trust the optimization?**
**A:** Yes! It's based on proven retail methodology (Anchor-and-Spokes) and mathematical optimization. Industry-standard approach.

**Q: What if I don't like the results?**
**A:** You can:
- Run optimization again (might get slightly different results)
- Manually adjust with drag-and-drop
- Reset and start over

**Q: Will it really improve my sales by 35%?**
**A:** The 35% is a measure of layout quality improvement, not guaranteed sales. Real results depend on many factors. But better layouts DO typically improve sales 15-25%.

**Q: Does it consider seasonal changes?**
**A:** Not automatically, but you can:
- Update your product list seasonally
- Re-run optimization for each season
- Keep different exports for winter/summer/etc.

---

### About Data

**Q: What if I don't know my sales velocity?**
**A:** Make an educated guess! Estimate monthly sales per product. Even rough estimates work okay.

**Q: Do I need exact product weights?**
**A:** Nope! Approximate weights are fine. It's mainly to prevent fixture overload.

**Q: Can I import from Excel?**
**A:** Yes! Save your Excel file as CSV first (File → Save As → CSV format).

**Q: What if my products don't fit the categories?**
**A:** Make up your own categories! The tool doesn't care what they're called. Use what makes sense for you.

**Q: Can I import products from my POS system?**
**A:** If your POS can export to CSV with the required columns, yes! You might need to rename columns to match.

---

### About Export

**Q: What do I do with the PNG file?**
**A:** Print it! Hang it in your back room. Give it to your staff. Use it as a reference during store reset.

**Q: What do I do with the CSV file?**
**A:** Open in Excel. Sort by fixture. Create a checklist for your team. Assign different fixtures to different people.

**Q: Can I import the CSV back into the tool?**
**A:** Yes! You can import, modify, optimize, export, repeat as needed.

**Q: Where's the PDF export?**
**A:** Coming in a future version! For now, use PNG + CSV together.

---

### About Setup

**Q: I picked the wrong store size. Can I change it?**
**A:** Just refresh the page (F5) and go through the wizard again. Pick the right size this time!

**Q: Can I add more fixtures later?**
**A:** Not directly in this version. You'd need to restart and pick a different store size.

**Q: What if my store has 7 fixtures but I picked "Small" (3-5)?**
**A:** Refresh and pick "Medium" (6-10) instead. Better to have too many than too few!
