---

## Validation Gate Template

Each phase must pass these checks before proceeding:

- [ ] All deliverables completed
- [ ] Core functionality works as specified
- [ ] No breaking bugs or crashes
- [ ] Documentation updated (PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md)
- [ ] Git committed with descriptive message
- [ ] Within 150% time budget (or overage justified)

If validation fails:
1. Allocate buffer time (max 90min from contingency)
2. Retry with focused fixes
3. If still fails: Document, defer, continue with workaround
4. If critical blocker: Emergency rollback to last good commit

---

## Rollback System

### Git Snapshot Process

Before each phase:
1. Create snapshot branch: `snapshot-phase-N-YYYYMMDD`
2. Commit with message: "Snapshot before Phase N: [Description]"
3. Continue work on main branch

### Emergency Rollback

If critical blocker occurs:
```bash
git checkout snapshot-phase-N-YYYYMMDD
git checkout -b recovery-phase-N
# Fix issue
# Merge back to main when stable
```

### Rollback Triggers

- Validation fails twice despite buffer time allocation
- Critical bug introduced that blocks all progress
- Technology decision proves fundamentally flawed
- Time overrun exceeds 200% of phase budget
