## The Six Mentors - Color & Psychology System

### Level 1: Andrew Carnegie - "The Greeter's Art"
**Domain:** Customer Flow & First Impressions
**Color Palette:** Warm Peach/Coral (approachability, welcome)
- Primary Background: `linear-gradient(135deg, #FFF5ED 0%, #FFE9D6 50%, #FFD4B0 100%)`
- Containers: Brown `#8B7355` (museum wood)
- Interactive: Coral `#E8997A` (warmth)
- Success: Soft gold `#F7CB42` (recognition)

**Psychology:** First impressions matter. Warm colors reduce anxiety and create instant comfort.

**Story Hook:** *"Welcome, young curator. I built libraries and concert halls across America. The first 10 seconds determine if someone stays or leaves. Let me teach you the art of the perfect welcome."*

**Game Mechanic:** Pattern recognition - route visitors based on subtle cues
- VIP indicators (clothing, body language, urgency)
- Regular visitors (browsers, learners)
- Special needs (accessibility, children)

**Progression Reward:** Unlock "Carnegie's Smile" badge - +10% visitor satisfaction

---

### Level 2: Johann Sebastian Bach - "The Harmony of Space"
**Domain:** Arrangement & Multi-Constraint Optimization
**Color Palette:** Soft Blue (trust, precision, order)
- Primary Background: `linear-gradient(135deg, #EBF5FB 0%, #D6EAF8 50%, #AED6F1 100%)`
- Containers: Brown `#8B7355` (museum wood)
- Interactive: Deep blue `#5DADE2` (logic)
- Success: Teal `#48C9B0` (harmony)

**Psychology:** Blue signals competence and reduces impulsivity - perfect for strategic thinking.

**Story Hook:** *"Music is mathematics made audible. A gallery is music made visible. Every piece must sing with its neighbors. Let me show you the fugue of perfect placement."*

**Game Mechanic:** Constraint satisfaction - balance multiple competing factors
- Visual harmony (style compatibility)
- Spatial rhythm (size and spacing)
- Thematic consonance (historical period)
- Lighting requirements
- Traffic flow

**Progression Reward:** Unlock "Bach's Fugue" - ability to see harmony scores

---

### Level 3: Richard Feynman - "The Living Gallery"
**Domain:** Emergent Behavior & Environmental Systems
**Color Palette:** Organic Green/Earth (nature, growth, balance)
- Primary Background: `linear-gradient(135deg, #E8F5E9 0%, #C8E6C9 50%, #A5D6A7 100%)`

**Psychology:** Green reduces stress and increases focus - ideal for complex systems thinking.

**Story Hook:** *"Physics taught me that simple rules create complex beauty. Your gallery is alive - temperature, light, humidity dance together. Master the invisible forces and watch wonder emerge."*

**Game Mechanic:** Systems management - balance interdependent variables
- Temperature affects visitor comfort and art preservation
- Humidity protects artifacts but can feel heavy
- Lighting creates mood but causes deterioration
- Emergent behaviors: visitors cluster, mood spreads, unexpected synergies

**Environmental Storytelling:**
- Groot (tree sprite) appears when balance is perfect
- Thunder clouds when systems fail

- Success: Bright cyan `#4DD0E1` (clarity)
- Warning: Lavender `#B39DDB` (caution)
- Error: Rose `#F06292` (mistake)

**Psychology:** Purple stimulates creativity and problem-solving. It's the color of the unconventional - perfect for AI learning.

**Story Hook:** *"I broke the Enigma by seeing patterns others missed. Every customer is a puzzle. The right response at the right moment changes everything. Let me teach you to think like a machine that learns."*

**Game Mechanic:** Decision trees - contextual response selection
- 20 customer service scenarios
- 3 response options each (perfect/neutral/poor)
- Context matters: tone, history, urgency
- Learn patterns: certain responses work in certain contexts
- Win condition: 15/20 perfect responses

**Visual Feedback:**
- Perfect: Cyan glow + "+10 insight"
- Neutral: Soft lavender + "+5 knowledge"
- Poor: Rose fade + "Try again"
