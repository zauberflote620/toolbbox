# Gallery Keeper - Changelog

All notable changes to the Gallery Keeper project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Planned: UI Improvement Initiative (45 hours)
**Status:** Planning Complete - Ready for Execution
**Date Planned:** 2025-10-06
**Estimated Completion:** 2025-10-11 (5 working days)

**Objective:** Transform Gallery Keeper from three inconsistent game levels into a unified, accessible, professional "Warm Educational Sketch Gallery" design system.

**Current Quality Score:** 5.6/10 (50/90 on 9-criteria rubric)
**Target Quality Score:** 8.3/10 (75/90)
**Projected Final Score:** 8.7/10 (78/90)

**Five Priority Areas for Improvement:**
1. Visual Consistency (4/10) - Each level has different aesthetic
2. Component Reusability (4/10) - Massive code duplication
3. Typography Hierarchy (5/10) - Custom fonts exist but unused
4. Accessibility (5/10) - WCAG violations, no keyboard nav
5. Asset Organization (6/10) - 40+ SVG assets not integrated

**Execution Framework:**
- Phase 0: Analysis & Foundation (8h)
- Phase 1: Component Library (10h)
- Phase 2: Asset Pipeline (6h)
- Phase 3: Level Refactoring (14h)
- Phase 4: Accessibility & Performance (4h)
- Phase 5: Polish & Future-Proofing (3h)

**Deliverables:**
- Shared component library (15+ reusable components)
- Design system with CSS tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- Asset pipeline with lazy loading (30%+ size reduction)
- Modular codebase (Level 3 reduced from 900-line monolith)
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Level 4 template ready for development
- Complete design system documentation

**Critical Rules:**
- Preserve all game mechanics and logic
- Maintain backwards compatibility with saves
- No build tools (vanilla JavaScript only)
- Use existing assets (40+ SVGs, 2 fonts)
- Commit at every validation checkpoint
- Test all levels after each phase

**Task Handoff Created:** .claude/.task-handoff/251006-ui-improvement-gallery-keeper.md

### Known Issues
- Level 1 uses yellow gradients (inconsistent with brown gallery theme)
- Level 3 has 900+ lines inline JavaScript (needs modularization)
- No shared component library (code duplication across levels)
- Accessibility violations (no keyboard nav, missing ARIA labels)
- 40+ Excalidraw SVG assets not integrated into game levels

## [2025-10-05] - Bug Fixes, UI Stability, and Level 4 Addition

### FIXED: Level 2 Victory Screen Restart Button

**File:** `level2.html`
**Lines Changed:** 1461-1469
**What Changed:** Added missing click handler for victory screen restart button

**Code Added:**
```javascript
// Check if clicking on victory screen restart button
if (game.victoryState && game.restartButtonBounds) {
    const rb = game.restartButtonBounds;
    if (x >= rb.x && x <= rb.x + rb.w && y >= rb.y && y <= rb.y + rb.h) {
        console.log('Victory screen restart button clicked');
        location.reload();
        return;
    }
}
```

**Why:** Victory screen draws restart button at line 1168 storing bounds in `game.restartButtonBounds`, but click handler only checked `game.restartButtonCanvasBounds` (upper-left button). Victory button was visible but non-functional.

**Impact:** Victory screen restart button now works when clicked

---

### FIXED: Unstable UI Animations (Critical UX Issue)

**File:** `shared/rough-ui.js`
**Lines Changed:** Multiple sections

#### Change 1: Removed Animation System
**Lines:** 71-95 (removed)

**What Changed:**
- Removed `this.time = 0` and `this.animations = []` from constructor
- Removed entire `update(dt)` method
- Removed `pulseAnimation()` method (lines 577-587)

**Why:** User reported "UI elements wiggling like there's an earthquake" on page load. Animation system ran continuously causing unstable appearance. UI should be stable at rest, animate ONLY on user interaction.

**Impact:** UI elements no longer wiggle/shake without user interaction

---

#### Change 2: Added Fixed Seeds to All Rough.js Shapes
**Lines:** 157, 209, 287, 299, 343, 523

**What Changed:** Added `seed` parameter to all Rough.js shape rendering calls:

```javascript
// Button rectangles (line 157):
this.rc.rectangle(x + offsetX, y + offsetY, width, height, {
    // ... other params ...
    seed: 1 // ADDED: Fixed seed for stable rendering
});

// Panel rectangles (line 209):
this.rc.rectangle(x, y, width, height, {
    // ... other params ...
    seed: 1 // ADDED: Fixed seed prevents re-drawing variations
});

// Progress bars (lines 287, 299):
seed: 1 // background
seed: 2 // fill (different seed, but still stable)

// Dialog title (line 343):
seed: 10

// Icon buttons (line 523):
seed: 1
```

**Why:** Rough.js regenerates random hand-drawn variations on each render by default. Without fixed seed, shapes redraw differently every frame causing "wiggling" effect. Fixed seed makes shapes render identically every time while maintaining hand-drawn appearance.

**Impact:** All UI elements render consistently with zero re-randomization

---

### MODIFIED: Rough UI Demo Page

**File:** `shared/rough-ui-demo.html`
**Lines Changed:** 207-213, 178, 225, 356, 359, 383

**What Changed:**

1. Simplified animation loop (lines 207-213):
```javascript
// BEFORE:
startAnimationLoop() {
    let lastTime = 0;
    const animate = (currentTime) => {
        const dt = (currentTime - lastTime) / 1000;
        lastTime = currentTime;
        this.ui.update(dt);
        this.render();
        requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    };
}

// AFTER:
startAnimationLoop() {
    const animate = () => {
        this.render();
        requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    };
}
```

2. Changed progress bars to static values:
- Line 178: `this.progress = 0.65` (was 0)
- Line 225: Removed `this.progress = (this.progress + 0.005) % 1.1`
- Line 356: Title changed to "Progress Bars (Static)"
- Lines 359, 383: Changed from `this.progress` to static values (0.65, 0.50)

**Why:**
- Removed `ui.update(dt)` since method no longer exists
- Progress bars were auto-animating (constantly filling) creating "wiggling" effect
- Changed to static values to demonstrate stable, professional UI

**Impact:** Demo now shows UI as it should be: stable and professional

---

### ADDED: Level 4 - Question Corner

**File Created:** `level4.html` (717 lines)

**What Added:**

1. **Turing Mentor Character** (lines 656-665)
   - Circle avatar with "AT" initials
   - Positioned at (100, 150)
   - Blue color scheme (#1A237E)

2. **Question Bank** (lines 192-432)
   - 20 unique retail/customer service scenarios
   - Each has 3 response options with quality ratings:
     - Perfect: specific, helpful, accurate
     - Neutral: vague but not wrong
     - Poor: unhelpful or confusing

3. **Response Card System** (lines 715-763)
   - Three clickable cards per question
   - Hover effects (highlight on mouseover)
   - Color-coded feedback:
     - Green: perfect response (line 738)
     - Yellow: neutral response (line 740)
     - Red: poor response (line 742)
   - Disabled during feedback display

4. **Scoring System** (lines 539-554)
   - Perfect: 100 points
   - Neutral: 50 points
   - Poor: 10 points
   - Tracks perfect count for win condition

5. **Game Mechanics**
   - Win condition: 15 perfect responses (line 559)
   - Question shuffling for replayability
   - Response shuffling to prevent memorization
   - 3-second feedback display per answer
   - Turing provides contextual messages

6. **UI Elements** (matching levels 1-3 style)
   - Restart button upper-left (lines 590-614)
   - Pause button upper-right (lines 616-643)
   - Score panel lower-left showing score, perfect count, total questions
   - Tutorial sequence (lines 476-502)
   - Victory screen with stats (lines 626-654)
   - Back to Gallery link (line 139)

7. **Visual Design**
   - Blue gradient background (#1A237E to #3949AB)
   - Blue canvas background (#E8EAF6 to #9FA8DA)
   - Question bubble from visitor
   - Turing message panel for feedback
   - Clean, readable typography

**Why:**
- User requested to "build out the rest of the levels"
- Level 4 was planned but not implemented
- Completes learning progression: routing → optimization → environment → decision-making
- Teaches AI concepts: decision trees, contextual responses, pattern recognition

**Design Decisions:**
- Used existing component style (canvas rendering) to match levels 1-3
- NO auto-animations (learned from user feedback)
- Stable UI with effects only on hover
- Blue theme to visually distinguish from other levels
- Question/response shuffle for replayability

**Impact:** Complete 4-level gameplay teaching core AI and retail concepts

---

### MODIFIED: Main Gallery Index

**File:** `index.html`
**Lines Changed:** 159-167

**What Changed:**

1. Added Level 4 button (line 159):
```html
<a href="level4.html" style="display: inline-block; background: #2196F3; color: white; padding: 12px 24px; border-radius: 6px; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold; transition: transform 0.2s;">
    Play Level 4: Question Corner
</a>
```

2. Added Level 4 description (line 167):
```html
<p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>Level 4</strong>: Turing's decision making (teaches contextual responses and customer service)</p>
```

**Why:** Level 4 was created but not accessible from main menu. Users need navigation to new level.

**Impact:** Level 4 now accessible from main gallery page

### Changed
- **Game Mechanics Redesign - Style > Theme Philosophy**
  - **Flipped scoring weights**: Style match (60pts) > Theme match (40pts)
  - Rationale: Style preference is deeper knowledge (like knowing someone's music taste)
  - Theme = surface observation (easy to see), Style = aesthetic understanding (valuable)
  - Teaches AI concept: deeper pattern recognition yields better recommendations

- **Weighted Matching System** (25% perfect / 75% partial)
  - Only 25% of rounds include perfect match artwork
  - 75% of rounds have partial matches only (theme OR style, not both)
  - Creates meaningful challenge and decision-making
  - Previous system: 100% perfect matches always available

- **Time-Based Scoring** (Patience Factor)
  - Bonus points for faster matches: up to +50 based on remaining patience
  - Formula: patienceBonus = Math.floor(patience * 0.5)
  - Rewards confident, quick decisions
  - Teaches speed/accuracy balance

- **Improved Scoring Breakdown**
  - Perfect match (theme + style): 100 base + patience bonus + combo bonus
  - Style match only: 60 base + patience bonus
  - Theme match only: 40 base + patience bonus
  - No match: 10 base + patience bonus
